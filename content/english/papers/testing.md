Abstract : _This paper utilizes the de-identified and aggregated Facebook friendship network across Indian geography to explore which factors determine the patterns of social connectedness. I find that geographical distance and state boundaries can play a significant role in influencing network patterns, and the elasticity increases as we look at regions located closer to each other. I also showcase the existence of homophily along the dimensions of literacy, language, caste, and religion. Through a set of simulations (DeGroot learning), I further look at the implications of such network structure on the speed of learning._
