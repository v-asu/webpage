Hi, I am Vasu Chaudhary. I have a Masters degree in Economics from [Delhi School of Economics](http://econdse.org). I currently work as a Research Associate at the [Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia). Here, as part of the social networks lab, I have worked on multiple projects in the field of Development Economics. I engage in tasks ranging from designing experiments to their implementation in the field, as well as analysing the data collected to produce end results.
